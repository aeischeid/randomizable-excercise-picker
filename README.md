Developed this for a physical therapist friend who want'd a simple tool to randomize workouts a bit. tried to make it mobile friendly.

Uses Spine.js to give stucture and some localstorage persistence help. jquery too.

Could probably be adapted to work for other simple random picker type things pretty easily or.

Serves as a not very great example of a spine app. simpler than some of the other demo's out there for people just learning it though.
